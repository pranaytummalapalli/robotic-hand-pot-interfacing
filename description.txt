This project is a very elementary model of how we could possibly control the limbs of an exoskeleton in the near future. Exoskeletons, like the ones in the movie avatar, can prove to be very useful to manual labour. They can ease out a lot of tasks for humans from load bearing to fighting wars for us. All movements involved in such operations can be controlled by using flex sensors to mimick the movements of the operator effortlessly.
This project uses potentiometers to control each movement. The working of a fle sensor is similar to that of a potentiometer. Each movement, the bent of each finger for example, is assigned its own potentiometer. The resistance from 0 to 1023 of each potentiometer is mapped to the required angle of bend of the servos attached to each finger with a string.  
This was varying the resistance of the potentiometer will make the fingers bend.
